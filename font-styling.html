<p class="demuc">I remember as if it were a meal ago...</p>

<p class="chinh">Said <span>Tommy</span> the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter

    had met its demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of
    this awesome prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban
    predator — <span>Tommy</span> the cat had many a story to tell. But it was a rare
    occasion such as this that he did.</p>
